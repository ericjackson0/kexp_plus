Actually, it's just a plaything I made to mess with the KEXP API: https://api.kexp.org/

and I submitted a postcard for Good Mail Day 2020 and I wanted to see when/if they were able to play
our request!

Trying to stick to vanilla JavaScript and HTML to better understand how the web works. I've been in
React/framework land too long. ;(
